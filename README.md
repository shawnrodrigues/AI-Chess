# Chess AI Game

Welcome to our Chess AI Game project! This is a Python-based implementation of a chess game with an AI opponent.

## Features

- Play against an AI opponent.
- Simple normal chess game visual interface.
- Implements standard chess rules.
- AI powered by [Minimax]algorithm with [Alpha-Beta Pruning].

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Terminal/console environment

## How to Play

1. Run the game: `main.py`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the AI.

## Gameplay Instructions
- The game will display the board .
- Input your moves 
- The AI will respond to your moves.
- The game ends when checkmate is achieved or when a draw is declared.

## AI Algorithm

The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make decisions about its moves. It explores the game tree up to a certain depth and evaluates the positions using a simple evaluation function.
